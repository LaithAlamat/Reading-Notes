## Debugging
-	Debugging is a step by step overview of a certain part of the code that helps us detect an error in the code.

## Debugging steps
-   In order to find the error in the code, we must know what our code is suppose to do in the first place, and isolate the part that is causing the error.
-   If we have more than one place that is causeing the error then we test them party by part we don't join more than one part in our test.
-   Keep your code simple so you can test the code without complixity and check that is running completely fine, especially when adding new parts to the code later on.

## A simple method of Debugging
-  Using the Try/Catch and Finally method we can handle errors whenever we expect them in our code, by using this method we can handle the error and tell the code what we need to do in case there was not an error and what to do if there is and finally to do something regardless if there was an error or not.

- The Common Language Runtime (CLR) catches exceptions not handled by catch blocks. If an exception is caught by the CLR, one of the following results may occur depending on your CLR configuration.


## Conclution
- Debugging is a avery important aspect of coding and every developer should use it always as it helps us dealing with our errors at our code at first and locate them early as this helps us save time and effort in our journy of coding a specific program.
